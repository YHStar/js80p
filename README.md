Features
--------

 * 16 notes polyphony
 * 2 oscillators (waveforms: sine, sawtooth, triangle, square, inverse
   sawtooth, custom)
 * 2 filters for each oscillator (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, bell,
   low-shelf, high-shelf)
 * portamento
 * wave folder
 * amplitude modulation
 * frequency modulation
 * phase modulation
 * built-in effects:
    * overdrive
    * distortion
    * filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, bell, low-shelf,
      high-shelf)
    * stereo echo
    * stereo reverb
 * 6 envelopes
 * 8 low-frequency oscillators (LFO)
 * configurable MIDI controllers

#### Aren't Phase Modulation and Frequency Modulation equivalent? Why have both?

The reason for JS80P having both kinds of modulation is that they are not
always equivalent. They are only identical when the modulator signal is a
sinusoid, but with each added harmonic, PM and FM start to differ more and
more. A detailed mathematical explanation of this is shown in
[pm-fm-equivalence.md](pm-fm-equivalence.md).

Name
----

In 2022, I started developing a browser-based synthesizer using the [Web Audio
API][webaudio], mostly being inspired by the [Yamaha CS-80][cs80]. I named that
project [JS-80][js80]. Then I started adding one little feature and
customization option after the other, then it got out of hand, and I also
started finding limitations of doing audio in the browser. So I decided to
implement a cleaned up (and antialiased!) version of this synth in C++ as a DAW
plugin, and so JS80P was born.
